# To download youtube vedios without those crappy adds anymore
<br>
I have used pytube library in this to download youtube vedios and for convinence i have used tkinter and used filedialog in that so it gives a dialog box like  to where to install your vedio
I think thats great and have fun play around with it. oh and be sure to "pip install pytube" to install this cool library rest all are built in .
